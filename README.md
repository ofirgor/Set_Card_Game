# Set Card Game - Multi-Threaded Java Implementation

## Project Description

The Set Card Game - Multi-Threaded Java Implementation project showcases a real-world application of concurrent programming. With a focus on the popular card game "Set," this project offers an opportunity to delve into concurrent programming principles while building an engaging and dynamic gaming experience.

## Set Card Game

The Set Card Game is a fast-paced and visually stimulating card game where players race to identify sets of three cards that satisfy certain conditions. Each card has four attributes: color, shape, number, and shading, and a set is a group of three cards where each attribute is either all the same or all different. Players compete to spot sets and claim them before their opponents, requiring keen observation and quick decision-making.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a multi-threaded implementation of the Set Card Game using Java. By incorporating concurrent programming techniques, such as Java Threads and Synchronization, players can enjoy a seamless and dynamic gaming experience with real-time updates and interactions.

## Technologies Used

- *Java Threads*: The implementation utilizes Java Threads to handle multiple players' interactions concurrently, ensuring a smooth and responsive gaming environment.

- *Java Synchronization*: Employing Java Synchronization techniques, the project maintains data consistency and prevents conflicts when multiple players attempt to claim sets simultaneously.

- *Unit Testing*: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the game logic, comprehensive unit testing using JUnit or similar frameworks is implemented.
